## An image hosting application

It's a simple front end, for image hosting services for voilk 
It uses `voilkGraph` as a backend for it

so make sure you have that up and running if you want to deploy it for your own projects.

however, you can connect to our endpoint as well 
which is already implemented in the code of it

1) clone the project
2) install using npm or yarn
3) `npm start` in dev mode

or build and host for deployment.
`npm run build`
